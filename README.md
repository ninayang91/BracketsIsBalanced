# BracketsIsBalanced
Check if brackets in a math expression are balanced

//Design a method to check if brackets are balanced

//Use stack to push the left brackets, keep scanning, 

//when meet the right, (if stack is empty, report wrong), if it is the match, pop, otherwise report wrong

//If finally the stack is empty, then it is balanced
